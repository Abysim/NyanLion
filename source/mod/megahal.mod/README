MegaHAL AI interface for Eggdrop by Steve Huston

Please note, not only do I know little of licensing stuff, but I at this point
don't care to write it either, so here's my stab at it: If this blows up your
machine, complain to /dev/null.  If it works well and you like it, drop me a
line at huston@elvis.rowan.edu, and if you have ideas to clean it up and such,
feel free, I'd appreciate a copy of the code so I can see what was done.

I hacked this together in a 24 hour period because I thought MegaHAL was cool,
and it would be neat to have an Eggie "chat" with the users in channel.  As it
stands, here's what must be edited:

In the commands sections, you must edit the command to match the bot's name.
Perhaps in a later version I'll fix this, but at the time I wrote it I didn't
see a way to have it recognize its nick "on the fly".  Simple fix: sed
's/KupaKawfe/<YourBotsNickname>/g' megahal.c > newmegahal.c.

You also have to take the megahal.??? files and move them to the root of
Eggdrop's running location.  Once this is done, either add "loadmodule
megahal" to your config file, or ".loadmod megahal" in DCC, and *viola*, your
bot is artificially intelligent :>

If you use this, drop me a line too, so I get an idea of how many people try
it and like it.

And lastly, the original source code and information can be found at the
author's site, http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch
